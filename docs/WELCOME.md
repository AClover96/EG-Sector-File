# How to use the IVAO XU Community Sectorfile

- Release version: 0.1-pre-alpha-1.0
- Release date: 
- AIRAC cycle included: 2113

# Installation

Welcome to the IVAO XU Community sectorfile for the London (EGTT) and Scottish (EGPX) Flight Information Regions.

Eventually this sectorfile will automatically compile the day before an AIRAC comes in to effect, and be uploaded to the IVAO servers so that it is available to use from 0001 UTC on the day the AIRAC cycle begins. **This doesn't work yet though so follow the steps below.**

1) Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/IVAO-XU/EG-Sector-File/releases) and find the latest release. It'll be at the top.
